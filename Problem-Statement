CONNECT – Comprehensive Organic Network for Nurturing Educational Community & Transformation

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

Problem Statement:

A mid-sized university with over 15,000 students experiences alarming dropout rates and diminished student success due to fragmented support systems. Research shows that 39% of first-time, full-time students fail to return for their second year, costing the institution over $9 billion annually in wasted tuition, financial aid, and potential revenue. Despite significant investments in academic advising, tutoring, and student engagement programs, these initiatives remain disconnected and operate independently:

•	Academic performance monitoring systems capture grades and attendance but lack insight into students’ social networks and sense of belonging.

•	Student risk identification is primarily reactive—alerts trigger only after grades drop or students miss critical deadlines—resulting in delayed interventions that often come too late.

•	Peer support and social integration efforts (clubs, study groups, campus events) operate independently of academic support services, missing the proven 80.6% positive correlation between strong peer relationships and academic achievement.

•	Intervention strategies rely on manual case management workflows, leading to inconsistent follow-up, misallocation of resources, and poor tracking of outcomes.

•	Data fragmentation across the Learning Management System (LMS), Student Information System (SIS), and various student services prevents a holistic view of each student’s risk factors and support needs.

•	Social isolation detection remains manual and inconsistent, leaving many at-risk students without timely outreach or community connection.

The Core Challenge:

No existing technology platform systematically integrates academic performance analytics with social network data to enable proactive, data-driven interventions. The university lacks the ability to automatically:

1.	Identify at-risk students by combining academic, behavioral, and social engagement indicators;

2.	Facilitate academically beneficial peer relationships using predictive matching algorithms;

3.	Coordinate interventions through automated workflows that notify advisors and support staff the moment a student’s risk score crosses defined thresholds;

4.	Measure intervention effectiveness in real time, refining strategies based on outcome data;

5.	Provide comprehensive dashboards for administrators to track retention metrics, resource utilization, and program ROI.

Project Objectives

CONNECT aims to transform student support by delivering a Salesforce-based platform that:

•	Integrates data from LMS, SIS, campus engagement apps, and student services into a unified student profile.

•	Applies predictive analytics to calculate daily risk scores for every student, enabling early warning before academic crisis.

•	Automates peer matching to create data-driven study partnerships proven to improve academic outcomes.

•	Implements proactive workflows to notify advisors, schedule support services, and track student progress continuously.

•	Delivers real-time dashboards for students, advisors, and administrators, driving informed decision-making and continuous improvement.

By addressing these core challenges, the university can achieve 15–20% improvements in retention rates, save over $180,000 annually per cohort, and provide every student with the social and academic support they need to succeed.
